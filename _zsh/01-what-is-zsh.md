When you start your computer, the usual thing that you get is a login screen. Once you login, you get to your desktop. Then you open a program and start working on whatever it is that you wanted to work on. But it wasn't always like that. Before Steve Jobs (and Xerox) changed our lives, computers weren't like this. Before someone invented a GUI (Graphical User Interface), we all had, and all we had was CLI (Command Line Interface) - the thing that we now call **Terminal**, or **Shell**. 

We are on the topic of ZSH, so it's time we tell you that ZSH stands for **the Z Shell**. It is one of the _Shells_ out there. You might wonder to yourself: _Why is it called a "Shell"?_

## Why are Terminals also called Shells?
