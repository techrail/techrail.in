Here is a potential outline for a course on the ZSH shell:

    Introduction to the ZSH shell and its benefits over other shells
        Brief history of ZSH and its evolution
        Comparison with other popular shells (e.g. bash, ksh)
    Installation and Configuration of ZSH
        Installation on various operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows)
        Setting ZSH as the default shell
        Configuring the ZSH environment with the ".zshrc" file
    ZSH Command Line Editing
        Basic movement and editing commands (e.g. arrow keys, delete, etc.)
        Advanced editing features (e.g. history search, inline editing)
    ZSH Customization and Themes
        Changing the prompt
        Installing and using ZSH plugins and themes
        Creating custom plugins and themes
    ZSH Advanced Features
        Command and File completion
        Aliases and functions
        Job control and process management
        Command history and history expansion
    ZSH Scripting
        Writing basic shell scripts in ZSH
        Using ZSH built-in commands for scripting tasks
        Debugging ZSH scripts
    Conclusion and Additional Resources
        Recap of the key features and benefits of ZSH
        Recommendations for further study and resources (e.g. man pages, online tutorials, etc.)

This outline should give a comprehensive overview of the ZSH shell, while also allowing for flexibility and customization based on the needs of the course.

What all parameter expansions are available in ZSH? 

ZSH supports a wide range of parameter expansions, which allow you to manipulate and extract values from variables in a flexible and powerful way. Here are some of the most commonly used parameter expansions in ZSH:

    ${var:-word}: If var is set and is not null, return its value. Otherwise, return word.
    ${var:=word}: If var is set and is not null, return its value. Otherwise, set var to word and return its value.
    ${var:?word}: If var is set and is not null, return its value. Otherwise, print an error message consisting of word and exit the shell.
    ${var:+word}: If var is set and is not null, return word. Otherwise, return an empty string.
    ${var#pattern}: Remove the smallest prefix pattern that matches.
    ${var##pattern}: Remove the largest prefix pattern that matches.
    ${var%pattern}: Remove the smallest suffix pattern that matches.
    ${var%%pattern}: Remove the largest suffix pattern that matches.
    ${var/pattern/replacement}: Replace the first occurrence of pattern with replacement.
    ${var//pattern/replacement}: Replace all occurrences of pattern with replacement.
    ${var/#pattern/replacement}: If the pattern matches the beginning of the string, replace it with replacement.
    ${var/%pattern/replacement}: If the pattern matches the end of the string, replace it with replacement.
    ${var:start:len}: Extract a substring from var starting at position start with length len.

These are just a few of the many parameter expansions available in ZSH. To learn more about these expansions and how to use them, you can consult the ZSH documentation or search online for tutorials and examples.
